# CS 474 : HW4 by Rishabh Goel

**Scaset** is a DSL(Domain Specific Language) developed for people who study Set Theory. This language will help people to run various set operations.

## <u>Points to remember</u>

1. Inner class object cannot access Outer class object
2. Outer class object cannot access Inner class object
3. If methods or fields are not provided with public, private or protected access modifier, they won't be accessible by the class object as they are not being tracked (Future work: Such variables to have public access by default)
4. Please provide all necessary parameters(Can be looked up from the table at the starting of README). Otherwise it will result in exception
5. Inner class is not inherited in child class. For eg. Class2 is inside Class1 and now Class3 tries to inherit members of Class1, then members of Class2 won't be inherited.
6. If Parent and Child class have same field or method, then field or member of Parent class is lost forever and we cannot access it through object of child class. But we can still access fields or methods of parent class using it's own object
7. Private members are not inherited.
8. Child classes can inherit from only 1 class
9. Only 1 inner class can be created
10. Make sure both class are created before you make one class as inner of another
11. Make sure both class are created before you inherit members of one class in another
12. `Extends` and `Implements` are the only functions that doesn't use `.eval()`
13. A class/interface cannot extend itself
14. An interface can inherit from an abstract class with all pure methods
15. An interface cannot implement another interface
16. A class cannot implement two or more different interfaces that declare methods with different signatures
17. An abstract class can inherit from another abstract class and implement interfaces where all interfaces and the abstract class have methods with the same signatures
18. An abstract class can implement interfaces
19. An abstract class can inherit from a concrete class
20. An exception is caught only if that exception has been thrown
21. Exception Class needs to be created first before throwing or catching an exception
22. Always create 1 field inside the Exception class definition to hold the exception message
23. If for some expression, value of a variable is not present, then it will result a partial evaluation (Refer testcases)
